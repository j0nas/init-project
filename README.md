Simple Next.js scaffolding for new projects.  
Regardless of how simple the setup process is, it's still wasted brain power.

<br/>
 
Running `init <project-name>`:
* creates `<project-name>` directory
* adds project *package.json* with React, Next, Prettier, Husky setup
* runs `npm install`
* adds a .gitignore file with predefined ignore rules 
* initialises a new git project and creates an initial commit with all new files  
* Starts the next.js dev server and opens localhost in your default browser

This tool is quite simple in its current state, but I would love to build on it.
